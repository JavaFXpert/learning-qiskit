# Manipulating quantum circuits

Qiskit has a powerful set of capabilities for defining, copying, extending, and otherwise manipulating quantum circuits. It also contains facilities for calculating circuit resources such as number of gates and circuit depth, and for computing a unitary matrix that represent the circuit.

To explore these capabilities, experiment with the Quantum Circuits notebook in the Qiskit tutorials.
