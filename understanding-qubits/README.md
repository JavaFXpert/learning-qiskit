# Understanding qubits

The _spin_ of a particle is a property that, along with position, mass, charge, etc. specify its state. Spin is a quintessentially quantum property, behaving in a way that exhibits all the aspects of quantum mechanics that make the subject counterintuitive.

The physical property of spin can be abstracted to the mathematical concept of a **qubit**, which is the quantum version of the classical binary bit.

Classical and quantum mechanics differ in two important ways:
