# Grover's algorithm

Grover's algorithm, published by Dr. Lov Grover in 1995, is a fundamental and widely used quantum computing algorithm. Grover's algorithm has the ability of searching an unordered set of items much faster than classically possible. Classically, the average number of queries required to find a unique item in an unordered set is $$N$$, where $$N$$ is the number of items. Using Grover's algorithm, the number of queries required is on the order of $$\sqrt{N}$$, which is a quadratic speedup. 

To get a working understanding of this algorithm, experiment with this Grover Search for Combinatorial Problems notebook in the Qiskit tutorials:
