# Shor's algorithm

Shor's integer factoring algorithm, published by Dr. Peter Shor in 1994, has helped generate widespread excitement about quantum computing. This is due in part to its potential of someday breaking RSA encryption.

Here is an excellent video from the PBS Infinite Series that describes Shor's algorithm in a very approachable way:

To get a working understanding of this algorithm, experiment with this Shor's Algorithm for Integer Factorization notebook in the Qiskit tutorials:
