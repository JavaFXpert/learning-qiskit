# Shor's algorithm

[Shor's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm), published by Dr. Peter Shor in 1994, has helped generate widespread excitement about quantum computing. This is due in part to its potential of someday breaking RSA encryption.

Here is a video from the PBS Infinite Series that describes Shor's algorithm in a very approachable way:

To get a working understanding of this algorithm, experiment with this Shor's Algorithm for Integer Factorization notebook in the Qiskit tutorials:
