# Simon's algrorithm

[Simon's algorithm and accompanying problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon%27s_problem), conceived by Daniel Simon in 1994, combines quantum and classical processing. It is an excellent algorithm to study in preparation for understanding the famous Shor's algorithm.

To get a working understanding of this algorithm, experiment with The Simon Algorithm notebook in the Qiskit tutorials:
