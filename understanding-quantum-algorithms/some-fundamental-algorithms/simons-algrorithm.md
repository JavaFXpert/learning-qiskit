# Simon's algrorithm

Simon's algorithm, conceived by Daniel Simon in 1994, combines quantum and classical processing. It is an excellent algorithm to study in preparation for understanding the famous Shor's algorithm.

To get a working understanding of this algorithm, experiment with The Simon Algorithm notebook in the Qiskit tutorials:
