# Deutsch's algorithm

[Deutsch's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorithm#Deutsch's_algorithm), published by David Deutsch in 1985, is considered by some to be the first quantum algorithm that demonstrated a speedup over classical algorithms. This speedup is achieved by the ability to find the answer to a problem that classically takes two queries, **in just one query**. Take a look at the Deutsch's Algorithm section of the following lecture by John Watrous at the University of Calgary for an excellent explanation of this algorithm:
