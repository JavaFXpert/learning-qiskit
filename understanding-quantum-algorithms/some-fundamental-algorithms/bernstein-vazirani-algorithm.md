# Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm

The Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, published by Ethan Bernstein and Umesh Vazirani in 2006, builds on the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and is good next step in your study of quantum computing algorithms.

To get a working understanding of this algorithm, experiment with this Bernstein-Vazirani Algorithm notebook in the Qiskit tutorials:
