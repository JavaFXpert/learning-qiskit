# Iterative phase estimation algorithm

Phase estimation algorithms are useful in that they find the eigenvalues of a unitary matrix. For example, **TODO: Provide a motivating example, and illustrate a unitary operator for which eigenvalues will be solved, providing the intuition for the algorithms \(both iterative and non-iterative\).**

This tutorial demonstrates an iterative version of quantum phase estimations, requiring only two qubits. To get a working understanding of this algorithm, experiment with the Iterative Phase Estimation Algorithm notebook in the Qiskit tutorials:
