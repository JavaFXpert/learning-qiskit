# Choosing your learning path

Everyone is unique, and we have varying prior experiences and learning styles. For this reason we've created three different starting points in this Learning QISkit guide.

If you're already familiar with concepts such as Dirac notation, select the following **Dirac notation and single-qubit gates** button. 

{% page-ref page="dirac-notation-starting-point/dirac-notation-and-single-qubit-gates.md" %}

If you'd rather take a learning path that begins with playing games and starts out easy on the math, select the following **Hello Qiskit chapter 1** button.

{% page-ref page="pauli-grid-starting-point/pauli-grid-and-clifford-gates/hello-qiskit-chapter-1.md" %}

Otherwise, take the following path that will introduce math concepts as needed, by selecting the **Next** button.
