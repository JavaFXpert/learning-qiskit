When a quantum circuit is executing, the states of individual qubits, as well as the circuit's overall quantum state, evolve. Because a quantum state collapses into a basis state when measured, we can't know with certainty what the quantum state before measurement was in a real quantum device. However, in certain types of quantum simulators such as a state vector simulator, we can access these quantum states. We can also use a technique known as _quantum state tomography_ \(see [Quantum State Tomography](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/master/qiskit/ignis/state_tomography.ipynb) notebook in the Qiskit tutorials\) to approximate the pre-measurement quantum state. 

To learn how to plot quantum states and measurement data, experiment with the Plotting Data in Qiskit notebook in the Qiskit tutorials.
