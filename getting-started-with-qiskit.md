# Getting started with Qiskit

Qiskit is short for Quantum Information Science Kit, and its home is the Qiskit.org website:

One way to run Python programs that leverage Qiskit is to use a Jupyter notebook. For example, check out this fun little Python program hosted on mybinder.org called Quantum 8-Ball:

{% hint style="warning" %}
TODO: Create a Binder image that contains only the Quantum 8-Ball program. That version of the program should only use the simulator as we haven't exposed the user to obtaining IBM Q credentials.
{% endhint %}
