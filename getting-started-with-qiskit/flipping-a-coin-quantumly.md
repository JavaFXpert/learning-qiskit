# Flipping a coin quantumly

Let's continue quantum programming by opening the following notebook, running each of its steps, and following its instructions for completing the coding exercises. This notebook, entitled [Flipping a coin quantumly](https://github.com/JavaFXpert/qiskit4devs-workshop-notebooks/blob/master/quantum_coin_flipping.ipynb), is a guided exercise that introduces the Hadamard gate, quantum superpositions, probability amplitudes, and measurement probabilities. It also serves as a gentle introduction to Dirac notation.
