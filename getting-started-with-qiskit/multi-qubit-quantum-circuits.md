# Multi-qubit quantum circuits

We'll continue quantum programming by opening the following notebook, running each of its steps, and following its instructions for completing the coding exercises. This notebook, entitled [Multi-qubit quantum circuits](https://github.com/JavaFXpert/qiskit4devs-workshop-notebooks/blob/master/multi_qubit_circuits.ipynb), is a guided exercise that builds on the previous one by creating circuits with multiple qubits and examining their quantum state vectors. It also demonstrates how quantum states may be visualized.
