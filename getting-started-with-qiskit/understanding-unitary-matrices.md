# Understanding unitary matrices

Take a closer look at the characteristics of quantum logic gates by opening the following notebook, running each of its steps, and following its instructions for completing the coding exercises. This notebook, entitled **Understanding unitary matrices**, is a guided exercise that examines, for example, why quantum logic gates are reversible. 

_Note: This notebook is currently being developed, and will be available here soon._
