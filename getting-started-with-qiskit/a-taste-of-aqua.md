# A taste of Qiskit Aqua

Now that you've had some experience using Qiskit Terra, it would be helpful to get a taste of what's available in the Qiskit Aqua library. Specifically, you'll experience using an algorithm named Grover search \(covered later in this learning path\) by leveraging a high-level library, rather than implementing it yourself. To do so, open the following notebook and run each of its steps, following its instructions for completing the coding exercise. This notebook, entitled [Using Grover search for boolean satisfiability](https://github.com/JavaFXpert/qiskit4devs-workshop-notebooks/blob/master/grover_search_party.ipynb) is a guided exercise that demonstrates how to use Grover search with the Qiskit Aqua library.

For another taste of capabilities in the Qiskit Aqua library, check out this [article on VQE](https://medium.com/qiskit/the-variational-quantum-eigensolver-43f7718c2747) \(Variational Quantum Eigensolver\). VQE is a quantum computing algorithm that is well suited for solving certain classes of problems, such as modeling molecules and combinatorial optimization, using quantum computers available in the near term.
