# A taste of Qiskit Aqua

Now that you've had some experience using Qiskit Terra, it would be helpful to get a taste of what's available in the Qiskit Aqua library. Specifically, you'll experience using an algorithm named Grover search \(covered later in this learning path\) by leveraging a high-level library, rather than implementing it yourself. To do so, open the following notebook and run each of its steps, and following its instructions for completing the coding exercise. This notebook, entitled [Using Grover search for boolean satisfiability](https://github.com/JavaFXpert/qiskit4devs-workshop-notebooks/blob/master/grover_search_party.ipynb) is a guided exercise that demonstrates how to use Grover search with the Qiskit Aqua library.
