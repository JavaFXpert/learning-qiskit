# Summary of quantum operations

So far in this section we've covered concepts such as unitary matrices, single-qubit and multi-qubit quantum gates, and measuring quantum states. The following [notebook entitled Summary of Quantum Operations](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/master/qiskit/terra/summary_of_quantum_operations.ipynb) contains a complete set of examples of these concepts that you may work through. It also will help you understand how to reset a quantum state, perform conditional operations, and initialize register of qubits to an arbitrary state. Take some time to explore this notebook, perhaps multiple times, until you are fairly comfortable with each of these concepts.
