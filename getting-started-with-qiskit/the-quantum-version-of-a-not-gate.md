# The quantum version of a NOT gate

Let's dive right into developing a quantum program by opening the following notebook, running each of its steps, and following its instructions for completing the coding exercises. This notebook, entitled [The quantum version of a NOT gate](https://github.com/JavaFXpert/qiskit4devs-workshop-notebooks/blob/master/quantum_not_gate_qiskit.ipynb), __is an introduction to creating a single-wire quantum circuit using Qiskit, and to the [Pauli-X gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate#Pauli-X_gate). It also introduces [qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit), including various ways to represent and visualize them.
