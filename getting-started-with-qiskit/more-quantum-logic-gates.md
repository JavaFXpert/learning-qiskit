# Rotating around the Bloch sphere

Continue building your quantum intuition by opening the following notebook, running each of its steps, and following its instructions for completing the coding exercises. This notebook, entitled **Rotating around the Bloch sphere**, is a guided exercise that explores the effects of rotating the state of a qubit on each of the three axes. 

_Note: This notebook is currently being developed, and will be available here soon._
