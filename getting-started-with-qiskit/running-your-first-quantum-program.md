# Running your first quantum program

The Qiskit framework leverages Python, and one way to run Python programs is to use a Jupyter notebook. Let's dive right in to running a quantum program by opening the following notebook and running each of its steps. There will most likely be concepts with which you aren't yet familiar, and that's OK, because this learning path will help you learn these concepts as you follow it. The primary reason for using this Getting Started with Qiskit Terra notebook now is so that you've experienced running a quantum program on a real quantum computer first-hand. Another reason is that even though you may not understand many of the concepts yet, you'll have been exposed to several quantum computing concepts that will eventually click into place.
