# More Qiskit features and running on real hardware

Now that you have some experience writing code that leverages Qiskit, let's revisit some features and explore some new ones. One such feature is the ability to run your programs on a real quantum computer, in addition to a quantum simulator. There may be concepts with which you aren't yet familiar, and that's OK, because you'll have been exposed to them for when they eventually click into place.
