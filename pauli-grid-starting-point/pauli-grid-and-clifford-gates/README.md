# Pauli grid and Clifford gates

A qubit might be an exotic quantum object, but the outputs it gives us are quite straightforward: nothing but simple 0s and 1s. One simple way to understand a qubit is therefore to focus on these outputs, and how they are affected by the operations in our quantum programs.

This approach works best when we only want to understand a small number of qubits. For the purposes of visualizing quantum states, it works best of all for two qubits. It is also best suited to a certain kind of quantum operation, known as Clifford gates.
